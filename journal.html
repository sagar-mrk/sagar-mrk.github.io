                <li>One is by wire method or property.So for contact details we used {@wire() con/getDetails(){};}</li><li>And another by calling a method imperatively.Also trained explained how to import apex class into components using '@salesforce/apex/classname.getmethod name';</li>
				<li>Also i learnt how to create select box and combo box.Created select box for printing account details,combo box to show the related contacts of that account id</li>
				<li>Trainer taught us about imperative calls that are used to control when the method invocation occurs that is on clicking the button </li>

				<li>I learnt about life cycle hooks.It's a callback method triggered at a specific phase of component instance's life cycle</li>
				<li>Constructor() is called when the component is created.This hook flows from parent to child.ConnectedCallback() is called when the element is inserted into a document.RenderedCallback() is called after every render of the component.Render() is used to override the default rendering.DisconnetedCallback() is called when the element is removed from a document</li>
				<li>To navigate in Lightning experience,Lightning communities and the salesforce app we used the navigation service,lightning/navigation</li>
